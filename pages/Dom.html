<h4>The Dom is a mountain of the Pennine Alps, located between Randa and Saas-Fee in the canton of Valais. With its 4,545 m (14,911 ft) summit it is the third highest mountain in the Alps and the second highest in Switzerland, after Monte Rosa.[3] The Dom is the main summit of the Mischabel group (German: Mischabelh√∂rner), which is the highest massif lying entirely in Switzerland.

    The Dom is notable for its 'normal route' of ascent having the greatest vertical height of all the alpine 4000 metre peaks, and none of the route's 3,100 metres of height gain can be achieved using mechanical means.[4]:114
    
    Although Dom is a German cognate for 'dome', it can also mean 'cathedral' and the mountain is named after Canon Berchtold of Sitten cathedral, the first person to survey the vicinity.[5]
    
    The former name Mischabel comes from an ancient German dialect term for pitchfork, as the highest peaks of the massif stand close to each other.
