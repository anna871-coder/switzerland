            Rosa-Massiv;
            French: massif du Mont Rose) is a
            mountain massif located in the eastern part of the Pennine Alps.
            It is located between Italy (Piedmont and Aosta Valley) and Switzerland (Valais).

            The Monte Rosa massif has four faces. Three in Italy: the Liskamm heading above the Val de Gressoney, the
            Valsesian face above Alagna Valsesia at the upper part of the Valle della Sesia, and the steep, big east
            wall
            above Macugnaga in the Valle Anzasca. And the Swiss north-western face with several glaciers (with one of
            the
            largest Alpine glaciers) flowing towards the Mattertal with Zermatt.[1]
